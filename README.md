# User-Authentication-System-with-JWT
Designing a User Authentication System with JWT using Node.js
I designed a user authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
in Node.js. The goal is to create a secure and efficient authentication system that allows users
to register, login, and access protected routes using JWT for authentication and authorization.
Tasks:-
1) Set up a Node.js project:
2) Create a new directory for your project.
Initialize a new Node.js project using npm init.
Install necessary dependencies such as Express, bcrypt, and jsonwebtoken using npm
install.
Design the database schema:
3) Determine the necessary tables and columns for storing user information (e.g.,
username, email, hashed password).
Create the necessary SQL statements or use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool l
ike Sequelize or typeorm to define your models.
Implement user registration:
4) Create an API endpoint for user registration, where users can sign up by providing a
unique username, email, and password.
Implement password hashing using a library like bcrypt to securely store passwords in the
database.
Implement user login:
5) Create an API endpoint for user login, where users can provide their credentials
(username/email and password) to obtain a JWT.
Verify the provided credentials against the stored values in the database.
Generate a JWT using a library like jsonwebtoken and return it to the user.
Implement protected routes:
6 ) Create API endpoints that require authentication using JWT.
Implement middleware to verify the authenticity and validity of the JWT provided by the user.
Grant access to protected routes only if the JWT is valid and not expired.
Error handling and validation:
7 )Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms for situations such as invalid credentials,
duplicate registrations, or expired JWTs.
Validate incoming requests to ensure required fields are present and meet specific criteria.
Testing and validation:
8) Use a tool like Postman or cURL to test your API endpoints for user registration, login, and
protected routes.
Verify that the authentication system is functioning as expected by checking for successful
registration, login, and access to protected routes.
Additional enhancements (Optional):
9) Implement features like password reset, email verification, or account deletion.
Add validation checks for strong passwords, email formats, or other custom requirements.
Explore integrating additional security measures such as rate limiting or IP whitelisting.
Note: Ensure you follow best practices for secure authentication, such as securely storing
passwords, using HTTPS for API communication, and protecting sensitive routes and data.
